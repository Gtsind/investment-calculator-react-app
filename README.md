# Investment Calculator App

A simple investment calculator app where information about a given investment based on user input will be displayed in table format.
Built with React.

1. On _load_ the user is presented with 4 different input fields where they can provide values for Initial investment, Annual investment,
   Expected return and Duration of the investment.
2. Those values are then being processed and the outcome is displayed inside a table under the input fields.

Note: A simple error message will be shown to the user if the value of the Duration input field is invalid (less than 1).

```bash
npm install
```

2. **Run the program:**
